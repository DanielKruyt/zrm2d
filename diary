Day 1 or 2:
	It's much nicer to just go ahead and do stuff. The feeling of actually
	accomplishing things is much nicer than trying to debug a heaving, dying
	mess of code that was pre-designed with no context. Hopefully I won't have
	any more random "okay okay lets just rewrite everything again" moments.
